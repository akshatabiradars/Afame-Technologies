This project aims to classify Iris flowers into different species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The dataset used for this task is the Iris flower dataset, which is widely used for introductory classification tasks in machine learning.

## Dataset
The Iris flower dataset is a multivariate dataset introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936. It consists of 150 samples, with 50 samples from each of three species of Iris: Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to train a machine learning model that can accurately classify Iris flowers into their respective species based on their measurements.

## Results
The performance of the trained model on the testing dataset will be summarized in this section, including accuracy and other relevant metrics. Visualizations such as confusion matrix may also be included to provide further insights into the model's performance.
